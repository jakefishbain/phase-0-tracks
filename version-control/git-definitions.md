# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control allows us to view history of versions and merge them together into the master.  Version control is useful becasue it offers save points. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the version you would like to work on.  It allows people to collaborate and all work on their own version of the file prior to merging it into a master later.  For example, we might create two branches in the octopus example, one for the heart glasses, and one for the cowboy hat.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit submits a file or folder change to the working repo.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when your current branch (the one you would like to merge) and the current branch on GitHub have disagreeing changes.
