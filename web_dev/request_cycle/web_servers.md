## In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?
A VPS is a virtual (digital?) machine sold as a service for a fee based on usage, and storage.  A VPS runs a copy of your chosen operating system and acts as a mini (or massive) computer you can remotely access. VPSs can be used to host a website through its cloning URL.  With the correct permissions set up and ports open, a website can be loaded in a browser.  VPSs are a safe choice in terms of messing up.  Your files exist on that virtual machine (in addition to where they were cloned from) and therefore can be destroyed or modified without affecting the 'original'.  VPSs are also very cost effective and accessible.

## Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
"Running an application using root just means you're giving the application a much higher level of access to do things on your behalf. This can be risky if the software being run is malign[ed]."
