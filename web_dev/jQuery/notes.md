###jQuery Plan

* Utilize videos and readings to grasp jQuery concepts
  * [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/dashboard/path/jquery)
  * [TutorialsPoint](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/jquery/)
  * [W3 Schools](http://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp)


* Spend ~20 minutes on each of the following components: 
  * Add event listeners for clicking, hovering, and other user actions
  * Add or remove CSS classes in response to events
  * Make elements fade in or out, slide up or down, or otherwise transition from visible to invisible
  * Grab values from forms

* Break after each component (~20 mins)

* Record notes here:
  * The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website.
  * jQuery can be installed locally or as a script in the head of an HTML doc

* Record questions here:
  * Which functions might you use not at 'document.ready'?


##### I found this plan to be difficult to follow, as I entered a number of rabbit-holes in researching and took a bit more time to figure out fading, hovering, etc...
##### I plan on continuing to explore jQuery with my pair tomorrow...
