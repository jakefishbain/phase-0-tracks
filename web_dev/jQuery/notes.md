* Spend ~20 minutes on each of the following components: 
  * Add event listeners for clicking, hovering, and other user actions
  * Add or remove CSS classes in response to events
  * Make elements fade in or out, slide up or down, or otherwise transition from visible to invisible
  * Grab values from forms

* Break after each component (~20 mins)

* Record notes here:
