		<h3>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</h3>
		<p>HTML 5 tags allow for people with visual impairments to read the screen through screen readers and other accessibility options. Being a special education teacher, I really appreciate learning about these modalities and determining how I can use them to best suit my visitors.  I see the "main" tag as most useful, as it allows the reader to know what the important content is on the page.</p>
		<h3>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</h3>
		<p>HTML displays the most recent element if it trumps a previous one (such as is styling or using CSS). The rules we set will "cascade" allowing the newest one to take place when necessary.  In HTML, the browser will load the page from top to bottom.</p>
		<h3>WHat did you learn about sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</h3>
		<p>I learned that sublime uses a snippet as a true snapshot of what is wanting to be inserted.  When I was playing initially, I thought we had to declare the doctype still, but now I understand that it really is just a "snip" of information we want to insert, rather than an entire document, for example, the html snippet.  I would like to keep exploring and see if I can format the email signature I created into a snippet.  I will have to remove some of the formatting, but I think it can work if I want to insert it at the end of each page.</p>
		<h3>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?</h3>
		<p>I think the most difficult concept for me in this challenge was deciphering exactly what a snippet is used for.  I will continue to read docs and watch videos in order to become more familiar with sublmie snippets.  Additionally, I would like to keep working with semantic elements.  I have a goal to write programs for students, and I believe that these accessibility options will be paramount for me to learn!</p>
